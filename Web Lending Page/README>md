# HTML Simple Project

## Overview
This project is a basic HTML webpage demonstrating a simple structure without using CSS. The design relies entirely on HTML attributes such as `font`, `align`, and `background`. It includes a navigation bar, headings, and a scrolling marquee.

## Features
- **HTML-only design** (No CSS or JavaScript used)
- **Background image** applied using the `background` attribute
- **Navigation menu** with links (not functional)
- **Centered headings and text** using HTML attributes
- **Marquee text** for a scrolling effect

## How to Use
1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Place an image file named `a.jpg` in the same directory as the HTML file.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
4. View the simple webpage layout and content.

## Requirements
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- Image file `a.jpg` (for the background)

## Future Improvements
- Add **CSS** for better styling and responsiveness.
- Implement **JavaScript** for interactive elements.
- Replace deprecated tags like `<font>` with modern alternatives.
