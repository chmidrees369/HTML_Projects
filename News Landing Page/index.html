    <h3>The recent attempts to ban the wearing of the hijab in colleges in the Indian state of Karnataka has been met
        with global ire and criticism – and rightly so. It has long been argued that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP),
        which has a stronghold in Karnataka, desire to implement its Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will only lead to the
        further marginalisation of non-Hindus in India. Hence, when hijab-wearing Muslim students were not allowed to
        enter schools and colleges across Karnataka, their protests symbolised the battle Muslims have had to wage
        against the increasing Islamophobia represented by the BJP.
        Videos of students being forced to take off their head coverings outside the gates of universities represent a
        terrifying image of where India is headed as a nation. Naturally, all such measures deserve universal
        condemnation; however, they must also prompt introspection.</p>

        <p> Many in Pakistan have voiced their horror and disgust at what is transpiring in India, calling for world
            authorities and governing bodies to take notice. In particular, Muskan Khan’s bravery and refusal to be
            intimidated by Hindu far-right goons has been lauded in Pakistan since it symbolises a Muslim woman’s right
            to
            wear a hijab. Similar sentiments are on display in Pakistan when other such instances have occurred around
            the
            world, such as the proposed banning of the hijab in France. Now, I must state at the outset that all such
            grievances are perfectly justified. The insistence of any country or citizenry to clamp down on an
            individual’s
            freedom to practice their religion must always be called out and condemned. But simultaneously, while we
            criticise other nations for their shortcomings, we must also understand how we as a country are failing our
            women and religious minorities too.</p>

        <p> Let us start with a basic example. How many of the people in Pakistan who are saying that women like Muskan
            should be allowed to dress how they want in India would have the same attitude towards women in Pakistan? As
            is
            demonstrated by the Aurat March year in year out, many men in Pakistan are desperate to police what women
            wear
            in public and are ready to argue whether or not it conforms to their pre-established notions of ‘decency’.
            The
            simple act of women marching together asking for their fundamental rights to be fulfilled leads to such
            vitriol,
            anger and backlash in Pakistan. Perhaps the same men who are calling for Muskan’s rights to be upheld should
            also try to raise their voices when women’s rights are squashed in Pakistan, or when Qandeel Baloch’s
            brother is
            acquitted after committing murder, or when the next honour killing is committed.</p>

        <p> On a similar note, when calling out religious persecution in other countries, we must also ensure that we do
            not
            turn a blind eye to the issues plaguing religious minorities and minority sects in Pakistan. From forced
            conversions, to false blasphemy charges, to the kidnapping of non-Muslim girls, to the marginalisation of
            Ahmadis, we as a country have failed on so many fronts. Hence, when we support Muskan’s fight, in the same
            breath we must also ensure that we call out our own state’s inability to protect the rights of religious
            minorities and women in Pakistan.</p>

        <p> Evidently, India is trying to turn the on-going ban into a debate about the hijab in an attempt to hide the
            fact
            that at its core, these sentiments are fuelled by the anti-Muslim agenda which the BJP has tried to
            promulgate
            for years. If anything, these state sanctioned acts should serve as a grim reminder to all those in Pakistan
            of
            just how easily the state can try to wrestle control and freedom away from its citizens. The fight being
            fought
            by Muslims in Karnataka and India is an important one, and we must voice our support for it. But this should
            not
            make us lose sight of the similar issues we face within our own country – otherwise, all anyone will see is
            our
            hypocrisy.

    Russia-Ukraine conflict may create wheat shortages in Pakistan, increase food inflation
    <h2>KARACHI:
        Covid and its various strains showed the impact of globalisation and the butterfly effect in action.</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>With the world becoming a global village, supply side disruptions caused their impact across borders and
        continents. The real face of capitalism emerged as producers stockpiled raw material and build reserves to
        ensure that the supply chain was not impacted.</p>

        <p> This added fuel to the fire and clogged the supply chain due to the unnatural jump in demand coupled with
            the
            already strained supply chain due to the reduced handling capacity at ports and staffing constraints.</p>

        <p> Inflation across the world is racing to peaks with the US inflation sprinting to a peak of 7.5%, euro zone
            and
            UK inflation at levels above 5% while locally we are facing inflation levels of over 13%.</p>

        <p> Commodity super-cycle seems not be taking a breather and has extended itself or may be converting into a
            bigger
            bull run. A fresh wave of stockpiling has started in fear of a disturbed supply chain in the face of
            escalating
            tensions between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

        <p> Commodity prices have restarted their race towards new highs and Brent crude oil has comfortably settled
            above
            $96 a barrel and is on track to cross into three digits to levels seen around eight years ago (in September
            2014).</p>

        <p> Auto consumers should tighten their belt as the raw material for chips – neon and palladium – is sourced
            from
            Russia and Ukraine and any supply disturbance is bound to compound the already prevailing chip shortage.</p>

        <p> Take a trip down the memory lane to see what triggered the Russia-Ukraine crisis and why has it surfaced
            again.

            The Russia-Ukraine conflict dates back to the late 2013 and early 2014 and is known in history as the
            Revolution
            of Dignity, which started in November 2013.</p>

        <p> It supposedly culminated with the annexation of Crimea in February 2014 by Russia into two states of the
            Russian
            Federation. Is the fight all about Crimea or is there more to what meets the eye.</p>

        <p> Some of the political analysts believe that Ukraine wants to align itself more with the EU and be part of
            the
            Nato security alliance rather than have a balanced relationship or a tilted bias towards Russia.</p>

        <p> This would potentially create barriers to Russian access to the Black Sea via the port of Sevastopol and
            could
            disturb its ecosystem and supply chain.</p>

        <p> Another thought process is that the media flare-up of the potential Russia-Ukraine war is an act to create
            hurdles in the way of Nord Stream 2, which is a gas pipeline between Germany and Russia.</p>

        <p> Some analysts believe that the US views this pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe. For Germany, the
            Russian gas is of immense help as it would support Berlin in delivering on its committed decommissioning of
            a
            nuclear power plant.</p>

        <p> As Russian gas becomes an important part of the economy, Europe’s trust in Moscow and its image as a
            potential
            trading partner is bound to improve. This would open a new potential free trade zone between Europe and
            Russia.</p>

        <p> Nord Stream is not just a pipeline; it is a window into the future – where Europe and Asia are drawn closer
            together into a massive free trade zone that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the
            US
            outside trying to look in.</p>

        <p> This would potentially end the ‘unipolar’ world order that the US has been driving for slightly less than a
            century and could mark the start of the decline of superpower and push it into an abyss.</p>

        <p> Whether fake or real; whatever the cause of escalation, one thing that we have seen is rising commodity
            prices,
            which has the potential to add fuel to the fire and send inflation spiralling to new peaks.</p>

        <p> Ukraine helps Pakistan meet the domestic wheat shortage as we have imported around 40% of demand from
            Ukraine.
            Any crisis in Ukraine would potentially create wheat supply shortages in Pakistan and certainly lead to
            higher
            food inflation via increased wheat prices.</p>

        <p> Not to mention, the increasing global prices are bound to push import costs higher and the current account
            deficit would balloon, putting pressure on our already precarious balance of payments situation.</p>
