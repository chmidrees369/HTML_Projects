        while now.</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Zainab joined the latest edition of PSL on Monday after taking a hiatus as she welcomed her first baby. While
        the fans welcomed the renowned host warmly, Erin was ecstatic to reunite with her 'behen' back on the field.
        Sharing a picture of the two on her social media handles, Erin captioned, "MY BEHEN IS BACK!"
        <p>Sharing another picture of the two, Zainab wrote, "Sis!" We love to see women supporting each other
            wholeheartedly!</p>
        <p>Earlier in an interview with The Express Tribune, Erin divulged into her relationship with Zainab. She also
            gives all the credit to Zainab for styling her immaculately. "Zainab has such a huge part in helping me with
            my wardrobe here. I am always calling her and asking her what and how should I wear this. She's been so
            great, honestly. She helps me pick the pieces I wear and is a huge help for anything I need to know," she
            told us</p>
        <p>Singing praises for her Pakistani counterpart, Erinadded, "She didn't really have to be this lovely, you
            know. So, when I came to Pakistan the first time, we decided we should do traditional clothing for Fridays
            and it just became a weekly thing." She went on," Now, whenever I am here, I would just casually call Zainab
            up and tell her, 'Girl, send me some clothes!' She's become, my personal stylist! We've become really close
            over time. She's been so great. She could have been not so welcoming but she is just a lovely person. She
            has been nothing but an open book. She's taught me so much."
