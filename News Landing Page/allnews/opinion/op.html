    <h1><ins>Masters of War</ins></h1>
    <h2>
        <p>You forcefully enter their lands, equipped with the latest armory. You ransack their homes, you loot their
            treasures, you dislocate their families. You don’t even show mercy to their children. You gather your
            nationalism and place on their lands your advanced artillery and infantry. You kill them in the name of
            patriotism fuelled by your deluded nationalism. You glorify your killings by labelling them terrorists.
            These
            terrorists, from whose land you extract minerals and leave them nothing but sand. Whose children are born
            with
            no socks on their feet but when they grow up, they walk on gold.</p></h2>
    <h3><p>You enter through their rich coastlines and you exterminate their fishermen. When the term terrorist doesn’t
            work, you label them as traitors and accuse them of orchestrating anti-state activities. You rid them of
            their
            pastors. Pellets of poison flood their waters. It’s the place where people are many and their hands are all
            empty and it’s where the damp dirty prison has an executioner with his face completely hidden.</p>

            empty and it’s where the damp dirty prison has an executioner with his face completely hidden.</p>
        <p>You camp in their mountains and you cause chaos. You exploit their resources and give them nothing. These
            terrorists, they fight and they resist. They resist your strength and they protect themselves. These
            traitors, they protect their land from the mighty hands of those who claim ownership upon it. These traitors
            live under inhumane conditions due to unavailability of education, basic amenities and infrastructure. These
            yokels, how dare they protect their own land with their sweat and blood?</p>
        <p>You force them into self-exile. By the scruff of the neck, you tell them they are no good. You drag them in
            courts, you accuse them of sedition. You exterminate their existence from the root. You encourage uprisings
            on their lands and order the locals to be killed. You see these people as obstacles to your nationalistic
            pride. You thrive on their poverty and enslave them. You put these traitors to work, you give them promises
            of profits but when push comes to shove, you jostle them aside.</p>
        <p>These dissidents, holding myopic views and suffocated ideals, protect their lands in the name of God. You
            deliberately deprived them of education and look what you’ve created now. Hordes of fighters who won’t lay
            down. Fighters who will go all to all lengths, to keep you away from their territory. You refuse to accept
            these lands as indigenous and these people as natives. You claim to own their land but what have you done
            for them? What have you done for ‘your land’? When they retaliate and kill you in self-defence, you reply
            with more fervour and more backlash.</p>
        <p>Resultantly, you face rebellion. The fire you started starts to spread beyond your control. You lose patriots
            in return. You pledge ‘eye for an eye’ and your people support your chauvinistic ideal. To curb mass
            rebellion, you abduct and ‘disappear’ people. You take away the informed youth, you kill the natives in
            numbers. You do everything you can, for years, to wipe these traitors away from their lands. And then you
            punch in the air and ask God for support. You brush off their blood from your tyrannical conscience and you
            march. You pledge and you vow to march and tremble till the heavens fall. You kidnap their children and
            enslave their families. But when they kill one of you, you ask for sympathy and in glorified martyrdom, you
            persist against these traitors. You pray and you beg. You shiver before God and you kill with more zeal.</p>
        <p>But then, in an epiphany, you realise their lands and their minerals are worth more to you. So, you make
            promises to them. You promise them what the gems you find. Once you dig out what you need, you kill these
            murderers. Upon your voyage, your morals and your values don’t stand. But everything’s fair in love and war,
            right?

            About time we learn from the cruel acts of Christopher Columbus and his fight against the traitors. Dare I
            say, quite relatable, isn’t it? History should not repeat itself.</p>
