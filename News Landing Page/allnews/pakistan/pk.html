    <h1><ins>‘Ghabrana nahi’, PM advises opposition</ins></h1>
    <h2>ISLAMABAD:
        Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that he always urged his team not to panic, and “today, I am telling the
        opposition ‘ghabrana nahi’ (don’t panic)”, as PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman
        met separately to discuss tabling the no-confidence motion against the incumbent government in the National
        Assembly.</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>“What was said about me here is which sentence I have uttered the most, so I want to tell you that what I
            have said the most is ‘don't panic’,” Premier Imran said while addressing the launching ceremony of the
            National E-Tijarat Portal on Monday.

            PM Imran said that when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf came to power, “the situation was very bad and the
            country was bankrupt”.</p>
        <p>“I was worried the team would panic, so I urged them not to panic.

            “This is what I used to say to my team when we were playing against the toughest cricket team [of that time]
            West Indies and today I am telling the opposition not to panic.”</p>
        <p>Further, the prime minister urged the younger generation not to miss the IT revolution which would generate
            revenue for them, assuring of government’s all-out facilitation.

            “This is the technology revolution. The youth should in no way miss it. We expect the country’s IT exports
            to reach $50 billion in a few years,” the prime minister said, adding that the government would remove all
            impediments to the IT sector to facilitate youth so that they could benefit from the technology revolution.
        </p>
        <p>He said the IT industry was youth-specific as tech giants became billionaires in their 20s and had old-aged
            people as their subordinates.

            The prime minister said consequent to the government’s incentives, the IT exports reached around $4 billion
            which would further increase to fill the import-export gap. </p>
        <p>Announcing zero-tax for registered e-freelancers, the prime minister said American technologist Bill Gates
            visited Pakistan last week on his invitation as he wanted to involve him in Pakistan’s IT sector.

            He said he would come up with a good news in a few days in that regard. However, he also lauded Bill Gates’s
            contribution to Pakistan for polio eradication as the country reported no case last year.</p>
        <p>The prime minister said the country’s elite-centric system always resisted the common man from excelling.
            “However, despite having no developed systems, Pakistan’s youth have immense potential.”</p>
        <p>He said the government had also introduced a core education curriculum for up to fifth class so far to do
            away with the systemic discriminations of English and Urdu medium education.

            Exemplifying a freelancer girl Nadia from Gilgit, Imran said IT provided the easiest opportunity,
            particularly for women, to contribute to the national development. Even the 60% population of the country
            under the age of 30 could be used for this purpose, he added.</p>
        <p>He said having an old connection with the overseas Pakistanis, he knew their potential as they excelled in
            numerous fields abroad wherever they got a level-playing one.

            The prime minister also appreciated his Special Assistant on E-Commerce Aon Abbas Buppi for his concise and
            informative presentation as well as his dedicated efforts to promote e-commerce.</p>
        <p>He told the gathering that the incumbent government had inherited a bankrupt country but being a sportsman,
            he knew how to sail through the difficulties and always advised his cabinet never to worry about it.

            Earlier, the prime minister also distributed awards among the youngsters running their startups in multiple
            fields.</p>

    <h1><ins>PM to fly to Moscow tomorrow</ins></h1>
    <h2>ISLAMABAD:
        Prime Minister Imran Khan will fly to Moscow this week to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Islamabad
        confirmed on Monday – the first such trip by a Pakistani leader in two decades.</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>The two-day visit, starting on Wednesday (February 23), was planned before the current crisis over Ukraine.

            "During the summit meeting, the two leaders will review the entire array of bilateral relations including
            energy cooperation," the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
        <p>They will also have wide-ranging exchange of views on major regional and international issues, including
            Islamophobia and the situation in Afghanistan, the statement added.

            In an interview published on Monday, the prime minister played down the timing of the visit, and any effect
            it would have on Pakistan's relations with the West.</p>
        <p>"This visit was planned well before the emergence of the current phase of Ukrainian crisis ... I received the
            invitation from President Putin much earlier," he said in the interview.

            Bilateral summit will be the highlight of the visit of the prime minister, who will be accompanied by a
            high-level delegation including the members of his cabinet.</p>
        <p>Pakistan and Russia enjoy friendly relations marked by mutual respect, trust and convergence of views on a
            range of international and regional issues.

            The visit of the prime minister will contribute to further deepening of the multifaceted Pakistan-Russia
            bilateral relations and enhancement of mutual cooperation in diverse fields, it added.</p>
