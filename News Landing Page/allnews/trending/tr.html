    <h1><ins>Afghan war crimes suspect says he is a victim of mistaken identity</ins></h1>
    <h2>THE HAGUE:A 76-year-old Afghan man accused of being the commander of the Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul in the
        1980s, where he allegedly abused political opponents, on Wednesday told The Hague court it was a case of
        mistaken identity.
    </h2>
    <h3><p>"I am not the person that you are talking about," the suspect, who said he did not remember his own name but was
        identified in court as Abdul Rafief, told judges.</p>

    <p> According to the charges summarised by the judges, Rafief is accused of living in the Netherlands under a false
        name and that he is actually Abdul Razaq Arif who served as commander of the Pul-e-Charki prison between 1983
        and 1990.</p></h3>

    <p><h3>Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government was fighting a guerrilla war against mujahideen rebels at the time,
        following the Soviet invasion in 1979.</p>

    <p> Prosecutors say Rafief was responsible for political prisoners in the jail, who were allegedly held in inhumane
        conditions in the facility. Guards under his command allegedly beat, tortured and executed prisoners.</p>

    <p> During the hearing Rafief referred all questions from the judges about his identity to his lawyers and said he
        was ill, dizzy and could not remember anything.</p></h3>

    <p><h3>Rafief came to the Netherlands seeking asylum in 2001 and has become a Dutch national. He is being tried under
        "universal jurisdiction" principles, which say suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity can be
        prosecuted abroad if they cannot be tried in country where they were allegedly committed.</p>

    <p> The Netherlands has already successfully tried three high ranking officials of the Afghan military intelligence
        service for similar crimes in the same period in Afghanistan.</p><h3>
