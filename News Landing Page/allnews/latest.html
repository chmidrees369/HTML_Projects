    <h1><ins>US warns nationals of possible terror attacks in Moscow, Saint Petersburg</ins></h1>
    <h2>MOSCOW: The US Embassy in Moscow has urged its citizens to refrain from travels to Russia amid possible
        terrorist
        attacks in Moscow and Saint Petersburg over the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</h2>

    <h3>
        <p>"According to media sources, there have been threats of attacks against shopping centres, railway and metro
            stations,
            and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St Petersburg as well as in
            areas of heightened tension along
            the Russian border with Ukraine,"
            the diplomatic mission said in a statement published on its official website on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The embassy did not specify what sources it used to issue a notice, and made some recommendations, including
            to monitor local and
            international media for updates, avoid crowds, keep in touch with friends and family, and mind the
            surroundings.
            It also advised to stay alert in locations frequented by tourists and Westerners, review personal security
            plans, carry proper identification, including a US passport with a current Russian visa, and have evacuation
            plans that do not rely on US government assistance. Commenting on the warning, Russian Foreign Ministry
            spokesperson Maria Zakharova asked whether the US diplomats shared with the relevant Russian law enforcement
            the
            information about planned terrorist attacks. "If not, how to understand all this?" she questioned on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US embassy information about possible terrorist
            attacks
            is being
            investigated. "This is a very, very unusual practice, such publications by diplomatic missions. We are
            looking into whether there were any signals from
            the Americans (about possible terrorist attacks) through the special services. I am currently unaware that
            such signals took place,"
            he told reporters at a daily briefing in Moscow on Monday. US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Russia
            is
            on the brink of invading Ukraine within "several days" . Tensions have risen dramatically in eastern Ukraine
            over the past days, with a growing number of ceasefire violations, multiple shelling incidents, and
            evacuation
            of civilians from the pro-Russian separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>
        <p> Western countries have accused
            Russia of amassing more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, prompting fears that it could be planning a
            military
            offensive against its ex-Soviet neighbour. Moscow has repeatedly denied any plan to invade Ukraine and
            instead
            accused Western countries of undermining Russia's security through NATO's expansion toward its borders. It
            also
            issued a list of security demands to the West, including a rollback of troop deployments from some ex-Soviet
            states and guarantees of NATO's further non-expansion.</p>
