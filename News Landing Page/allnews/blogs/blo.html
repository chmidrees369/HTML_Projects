    <h1><ins>Qandeel Baloch: Should we even expect justice for women in Pakistan?</ins></h1>
    <h2>
        <p>The people of Pakistan did not need another reminder of the injustice that is rife in Pakistan. From recent
            honour killings to casual accusations of blasphemy, it appears that the daily news cycle serves us with
            enough
            evidence of just how badly the state is failing its people. The irony, of course, is that even when justice
            is
            seemingly dispensed in some cases, relief for perpetrators in Pakistan is never far away, regardless of a
            guilty
            verdict or not. Hence, on the face of it, one gets the impression that the entire system and machinery is
            perhaps designed to see just how much state negligence and apathy the masses can endure. After all, we
            remember
            Shah Hussain’s early release from prison after he stabbed Khadija Siddiqui 23 times.

    <h3>
        <p>So when Muhammad Waseem openly confessed to the murder of his sister Qandeel Baloch, it was hard for most of
            us to imagine a more open and shut case. Instead a man, who should have spent the rest of his life in
            prison, has now been acquitted after serving less than six years of his sentence.

            For the uninitiated, Baloch rose to notoriety after her posts on social media caught public attention since
            they scandalised a largely conservative nation. A video of Baloch alongside Mufti Qavi in particular led to
            great uproar. Baloch had spoken about wanting to challenge and change “the typical orthodox mindset”
            prevalent in Pakistan. What Baloch’s brother did as a result is not a matter up for debate since he has
            previously spoken about it himself, stating,</p>
        <p>“My friends used to send me videos and pictures on my mobile and everyone in the mobile market was sharing
            pictures and videos of her with me. Murdering her was better than committing suicide so I went with the
            former plan.”</p>
        <p>“She was on the ground floor while our parents were asleep on the roof top. It was around 10.45 pm when I
            gave her a tablet... and then killed her.”</p>
        <p>Evidently, here we have a man who has stated his motive, and admitted to drugging and then murdering his
            sister. In his opinion, his sister had besmirched the family’s honour and forced him to endure shame and
            embarrassment, which is why he chose to kill her. Yet, only two and a half years after Waseem was declared
            guilty of the murder by a court in Multan and sentenced him to life imprisonment, he has been acquitted.</p>
        <p>There are several facets here which need to be addressed. Let us begin with the manner of the acquittal
            first. At the time of Baloch’s death, it was permissible for the family of a murder victim to forgive the
            murderer under Pakistani law. A legislation was subsequently passed against this law in the months following
            Baloch’s death, and the ability to simply pardon a murderer was to be rightfully taken away from any
            victim’s family. This, coupled with the fact that Baloch’s parents had initially said they would not absolve
            their son of the murder, meant that Waseem was handed a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
