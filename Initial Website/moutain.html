        <h1>Mountain Ranges of Pakistan</h1>
    </center>
    <h3><em>Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 metres and 4555[1] above 6,000 m. There is no count of the peaks
            above
            5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders) are in
            Pakistan
            (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin Austen
            Glacier).
            Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the
            Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a part of the greater Himalayan range) but some
            peaks
            above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over 7,000
            glaciers, more than anywhere except the polar regions</em></h3>

        <h1>K2 Mountain Range</h1>
    </center>
    <h3><em>
            K2 is a magnificent snow-covered mountain that reflects the powerful might of nature in all of its glory,
            making
            it marvellous and terrifying at the same time. It is the second-highest mountain in the entire world
            reaching an
            unfathomable height of 28,253 feet (8,612 metres). K2 is often referred to as the ‘Savage Mountain’ because
            it
            is an excruciatingly difficult ascent with one of the highest prevailing fatality rates for all climbers who
            dare to climb it. Despite its unconquerable terrain and unpredictable weather patterns, it appeals to
            climbers
            from all over the world. Even though it is located on the Pakistan-China border, climbers prefer to climb it
            from Pakistan’s side as it is more conducive to the activity. Even if you don’t aspire to join its summit,
            just
            the mere spectacle of this mighty mountain is a perspective-altering experience that allows you to
            completely
            become immersed in the all-encompassing magnificence of mother nature.</em></h3>

    <center><h1>Trango Tower</h1></center>
    <h3><em>The Trango tower, located in the Baltoro Glacier region present in the Gilgit-Baltistan territory, is the most
        spectacular vertical alpine climb in the entire world. It has intrigued and inspired alpine climbers from all
        over the world to achieve its nearly impossible ascent to the top. Against the backdrop of the mighty mountain
        ranges of the Karakorum, the Trango Tower stands erect with all the unfaltering pride and greatness of a Greek
        God. It is a mesmerizing sight and an arduous climb as it is completely vertical and its sheer magnificence
        makes it stand out amidst the entire range of peaks that surround it.</em></h3>
