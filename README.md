## About HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language for creating web pages and applications. It provides the backbone of web content, structuring elements such as text, images, links, tables, and multimedia. HTML works in combination with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

### Key Features of HTML

- **Semantic Markup** - Enhances accessibility and SEO using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- **Hyperlinks and Navigation** - Facilitates seamless navigation between pages using `<a>` elements.
- **Form Handling** - Enables user input with `<form>` elements, incorporating `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and other controls.
- **Multimedia Integration** - Embeds images, audio, and videos using `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` tags.
- **Tables and Lists** - Organizes data with structured table layouts using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, and list elements like `<ul>` and `<ol>`.
